```{r, setup}

library("here")
library("reticulate")

# load project_info list
load(here("tmp", "initial_setup.RData"))

project_seed    <- as.integer(project_info[["project_seed"]])
DIR_local_files <- project_info[["DIR_local_files"]]

path_to_ERP_step1_output <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/data_outside_repo/processed_data/ERP/step1/")

```

We are using `.Rmd` files because then all the output that the `.py` scripts print in the console is saved in the corresponding `.html` file. Note that this `.Rmd` file uses as a current working directory the directory in which the file is located. If I change this to the root of the `git` repo / `R` project, then image files will not be accessible (pandoc error 99).

```{python}
exec(open("RQ3_group_analysis_not_equalized.py", encoding="utf-8").read())

f_RQ3_group_analysis_NOTeq(project_seed = r.project_seed, 
                           path_to_ERP_step1_output = r.path_to_ERP_step1_output)

```
