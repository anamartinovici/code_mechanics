```{r, setup}

library("here")
library("reticulate")

# load project_info list
load(here("tmp", "initial_setup.RData"))

project_seed    <- as.integer(project_info[["project_seed"]])
DIR_local_files <- project_info[["DIR_local_files"]]

path_to_eeg_BIDS <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/data_outside_repo/original_data/eeg_BIDS/")
path_to_TFR_step1_output <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/data_outside_repo/processed_data/TFR/step1/")
path_to_TFR_RQ3_output <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/results_outside_repo/RQ3/TFR/")


```

We are using `.Rmd` files because then all the output that the `.py` scripts print in the console is saved in the corresponding `.html` file. Note that this `.Rmd` file uses as a current working directory the directory in which the file is located. If I change this to the root of the `git` repo / `R` project, then image files will not be accessible (pandoc error 99).

```{python}
exec(open("TFR_RQ3b_Decomposition_equalized_events.py", encoding="utf-8").read())

f_TFR_RQ3b_decomp_eq(project_seed = r.project_seed,  
                     path_to_eeg_BIDS = r.path_to_eeg_BIDS,
                     path_to_TFR_step1_output = r.path_to_TFR_step1_output, 
                     path_to_TFR_RQ3_output = r.path_to_TFR_RQ3_output)

```
