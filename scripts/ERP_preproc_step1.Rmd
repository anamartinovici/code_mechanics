```{r, setup}

library("reticulate")

# check working directory
getwd()

# load project_info list
load("../tmp/initial_setup.RData")

project_seed    <- as.integer(project_info[["project_seed"]])
DIR_local_files <- project_info[["DIR_local_files"]]

path_to_eeg_BIDS <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/data_outside_repo/original_data/eeg_BIDS/")
path_to_ERP_step1_output <- paste0(DIR_local_files, "/data_outside_repo/processed_data/ERP/step1/")
events_path <- "../data_in_repo/original_data/events/"
	
```

We are using `.Rmd` files because then all the output that the `.py` scripts print in the console is saved in the corresponding `.html` file. Note that this `.Rmd` file uses as a current working directory the directory in which the file is located. If I change this to the root of the `git` repo / `R` project, then image files will not be accessible (pandoc error 99).

```{python}
import os
os.getcwd()

exec(open("ERP_preproc_step1.py", encoding="utf-8").read())

f_ERP_preproc_step1(project_seed = r.project_seed, 
					path_to_eeg_BIDS = r.path_to_eeg_BIDS, 
					path_to_ERP_step1_output = r.path_to_ERP_step1_output,
					events_path = r.events_path)

```
